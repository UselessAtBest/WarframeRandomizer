<h2>Welcome to the first ever QTCC Creator Clash!</h2> 
This is an on your honor system. So please be cool. No cheating. You'll be streaming anyways, so chat will make sure you're not cheating, <b><i>RIGHT CHAT!?</i></b> 
<br>
<br>Objective is to defeat every boss and end with the Zealoid Prelate.
<br>You start on Mantle, then work your way nodes to get to the junctions and bosses. 
<br> The routes you take and nodes you clear are up to you!
<br>
<br>Use the check boxes below to check off a node as you complete them. 
<br>If you complete a Spy mission with no vault alarms going off, or a rescue mission without the guards being alerted,
<br> you get two points instead of one, tick both boxes for the extra point!
<br>
<br> Feel free to take this on with another streamer or some people in your community! However, they must follow the same rules and roll their own randomizer as well.
<h3> RULES: </h3>
1. Once you complete Zealoid Prelate you must show your Warframe and all weapon mods in the same clip as the end mission screen.<br> This is so we can go back at the end of the month and see what everyone used to complete the challenge and talk about it on stream. </br>
<br>2. <strong> Have fun! </strong></br>
<br>
<br> If you have any questions feel free to DM Slivarito <i class="fa-brands fa-twitch"> </i> on Discord <i class="fa-brands fa-discord"></i> or <a href="https://x.com/Slivarito" target="_blank">Twitter</a> <i class="fa-brands fa-twitter"></i>, IGN is the same everywhere.
<br>
<br> This page wont save, so make sure to take a screenshot <i class="fa-solid fa-camera"></i> of your progress, and your rolls so far (in the previous rolls menu)
<br> to make sure you don't lose your progress, <small><i> or just check your vod. </i> </small>
<br> 
<br> <h><strong> Good Luck!
